#SECTION - Fixed Height and Width of a screen

I want to build a dashboard.
The specific speficications are I want to fiexd the height of the screen.
I want the web content showed in a page under the fixed height and width of the screen.
Could you tell me how to achieve that?
To create a dashboard with a fixed height and width that fits the screen, and to display web content within this fixed area, you can use Reflex's layout components and styling properties. Here's how you can achieve this:

Use rx.box as the main container for your dashboard. The rx.box component is a generic component that can apply any CSS style to its children1.

Set the height and width of the rx.box to 100% of the viewport height (100vh) and width (100vw) respectively. This will make the box take up the full screen2.

Within this main container, you can use rx.flex or rx.grid to create the layout for your dashboard components1.

For the content that should be scrollable within the fixed height, you can use another rx.box with a fixed height and enable scrolling.

Here's a basic example of how you might structure this:

rx.box(
    rx.flex(
        # Your dashboard components here
        rx.box(
            # Scrollable content here
            height="calc(100vh - 100px)",  # Adjust based on your header/footer height
            overflow="auto",
        ),
    ),
    height="100vh",
    width="100vw",
)

In this example:

The outer rx.box sets the fixed height and width to the full viewport2.
The rx.flex component is used to create the layout for your dashboard1.
The inner rx.box is set to take up the full height minus any space needed for headers or footers, and has overflow="auto" to make it scrollable2.
Remember to adjust the heights and layout according to your specific dashboard design. You may need to experiment with different layout components like rx.grid or nested rx.flex components to achieve your desired layout13.

If you need more specific guidance or have a particular layout in mind, please provide more details about your dashboard structure, and I'll be happy to offer more tailored advice.
